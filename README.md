Excelsior JET WinService API
=====

[Excelsior JET](https://excelsiorjet.com) eases conversion of programs written in the Java programming language
into Windows services through providing the custom Excelsior WinService API and the required support in the compiler
and the run-time system.

The API is published at Maven Central to let Maven and Gradle users easily reference it from their projects
and subsequently build the projects with Excelsior JET [Maven](https://github.com/excelsior-oss/excelsior-jet-maven-plugin)
and [Gradle](https://github.com/excelsior-oss/excelsior-jet-gradle-plugin) plugins.

The complete documentation of the API can be found in "Windows Services" chapter of the Excelsior JET User's Guide.

**Note:** The API can be used only in conjunction with Excelsior JET JVM as other JVM implementations do not support it.
